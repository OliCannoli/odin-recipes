            Ratatouille is a French vegetable dish comparable to
            lasagna in its preparation. It consists of layered 
            vegetables layered in a casserole dish, though the 
            contents and consistency can be varied according to 
            the whims of the creator. While some may decry it 
            as a peasant dish, a humble origin does not define
            its capabilities.
