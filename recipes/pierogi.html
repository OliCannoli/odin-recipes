            Pierogi are a form of dumpling with an incredible 
            degree of versatility. They can be stuffed with all 
            manner of ingredients and then served on their own, 
            embellished with sauce, in a soup... the limit is 
            the chef's imagination. This recipe will create a 
            basic pierogi stuffed with mashed potato and cheese.
