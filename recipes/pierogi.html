            Pierogi are a form of dumpling with an incredible 
            degree of versatility. They can be stuffed with all 
            manner of ingredients and then served on their own, 
            embellished with sauce, in a soup... the limit is 
            the chef's imagination. This recipe will create a 
            basic pierogi stuffed with mashed potato and cheese.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>8 tbsp butter (have half ready at room temperature for the dough)</li>
            <li>1 cup mashed potatoes (warm)</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded sharp cheddar</li>
            <li>2 large shallots (diced) OR one medium onion (sliced)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>We start with the dough. Mix the flour and salt. Add egg and combine until clumpy.</li>
            <li>Work in 4 tbsp of softened butter and the sour cream until the dough forms a rough ball.</li>
            <li>Knead and fold the dough with your fingertips. Knead until the dough is moist, but not as sticky.</li>
            <li>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 to 60 minutes; it will keep for 48 hours if delayed preparation is desired.</li>
            <li>Make the filling by combining the potato and cheese. Mash them together until the cheese is melted and the mixture is cool. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Roll half the dough out to a thickness of 1/8". Cut out 2" circles of dough with a cutter. Repeat with the remaining dough.</li>
            <li>Place 1 1/2 tsp of filling at the center of each dough circle.</li>
            <li>Fold each circle and pinch the edges to form a pocket around the filling. Further seal the edge by pressing down with the tines of a fork.</li>
            <li>Save the pierogis for later, if desired. They can be frozen for 4 weeks or refrigerated overnight.</li>
            <li>Boil the pierogi in a pot of salted water. Add enough to give each one space to float without sticking to others.</li>
            <li>Remove and drain the pierogi when they float.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, saute your chosen allium in the remaining butter. Once they begin to brown, add the pierogi.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with any other desired embellishments.</li>
        </ol>
