# odin-recipes
A simple recipes page, created to practice HTML

This page is being created as part of the Odin Project
series of tutorials. Based on the content of the lessons
leading up to this project, it will cover creating HTML
pages, adding elements such as headers, lists, and images
to those pages, and then linking them together to create a site.
